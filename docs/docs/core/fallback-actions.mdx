description: Define custom fallback actions with thresholds for NLU and Core for letting your conversation fail gracefully with open source dialogue management.
---

Sometimes you want to revert to a fallback action, such as replying,
`"Sorry, I didn't understand that"`. You can handle fallback cases by adding appropriate
rules. Rasa Open Source comes with two default implementations for handling these
fallbacks.
In addition you can also use [Custom Actions](./actions.mdx#custom-actions) to implement
custom procedures.

## Handling Low NLU Confidence

Although Rasa's [Intent Classifier](../nlu/components.mdx#intent-classifiers) will
generalize to unseen messages, some
messages might still receive a low classification confidence.
In order to handle messages which have low confidence, we recommend to add the
[FallbackClassifier](../nlu/components.mdx#fallback-classifier) to your NLU pipeline.
The [FallbackClassifier](../nlu/components.mdx#fallback-classifier) will
predict an intent ``nlu_fallback`` whenever no other intent prediction crosses
the configured confidence threshold.

### Writing Stories / Rules for Messages with Low Confidence

When you added the [FallbackClassifier](../nlu/components.mdx#fallback-classifier)  to
your NLU pipeline, you can treat
messages with low classification confidence just as any other intent. The following
[Rule](./rules.mdx) will ask the user to rephrase whenever they send a message which is
classified with low confidence:

```yaml
rules:
- rule: Ask the user to rephrase whenever they send a message with low NLU confidence
  steps:
  - ...
  - intent: nlu_fallback
  - action: utter_please_rephrase
```

Using [Rules](./rules.mdx) or [Stories](./stories.mdx) you can implement any desired
fallback behavior.

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="two-stage-fallback"></a>

### Two-Stage-Fallback

The `Two-Stage-Fallback` handles low NLU confidence in multiple stages
by trying to disambiguate the user input.

#### Requirements

* Please add the [RulePolicy](./policies.mdx#rule-policy) to your policy configuration
  before using the `Two-Stage-Fallback`
* Before using the `Two-Stage-Fallback` you have to make sure to add the
  `out_of_scope` intent to your [Domain](./domains.mdx).
  When users send messages with
  an intent `out_of_scope` during the fallback (e.g. by pressing a button),
  Rasa Open Source will know that the users denied the given intent suggestions.

#### Usage

- If a NLU prediction has a low confidence score, the user is asked to affirm
  the classification of the intent.  (Default action:
  `action_default_ask_affirmation`)

    - If they affirm by sending a message with high NLU confidence (e.g. by pressing
      a button), the story continues as if the intent was classified
      with high confidence from the beginning.
    - If they deny by sending a message with the intent `out_of_scope`, the user is
      asked to rephrase their message.

- Rephrasing  (default action: `action_default_ask_rephrase`)

    - If the classification of the rephrased intent was confident, the story
      continues as if the user had this intent from the beginning.
    - If the rephrased intent was not classified with high confidence, the user
      is asked to affirm the classified intent.

- Second affirmation  (default action: `action_default_ask_affirmation`)

    - If they affirm by sending a message with high NLU confidence (e.g. by pressing
      a button), the story continues as if the user had this intent from the beginning.
    - If the user denies by sending a message with the intent ``out_of_scope``, the
      original intent is classified as the specifies ``deny_suggestion_intent_name``,
      and an ultimate fallback action `fallback_nlu_action_name` is
      triggered (e.g. a handoff to a human).

Rasa Open Source provides default implementations for
`action_default_ask_affirmation` and `action_default_ask_rephrase`.
The default implementation of `action_default_ask_rephrase` action utters
the response `utter_ask_rephrase`, so please make sure to specify this
response in your domain file.
The implementation of both actions can be overwritten with
[Custom Actions](./actions.mdx#custom-actions).

To use the `Two-Stage-Fallback` for messages with low NLU confidence, add the
following [Rules](./rules.mdx) to your training data. This rule will make sure that the
`Two-Stage-Fallback` will be activated whenever the user send a message which receives
low classification confidence.

```yaml
rules:

- rule: Implementation of the Two-Stage-Fallback
  steps:
  - ...
  - intent: nlu_fallback
  - action: two_stage_fallback
  - form: two_stage_fallback
```

## Handling Low Core Confidence

Similar as users might send unexpected messages,
it is also possible that their behavior might lead them down unknown conversation paths.
Rasa's machine learning policies such as the [TED Policy](./policies.mdx#ted-policy)
are optimized to handle these unknown paths.

To handle cases where even the machine learning policies can't predict the
next action with confidence, make sure to add the
[RulePolicy](./policies.mdx#rule-policy) to your
policy configuration. The [RulePolicy](./policies.mdx#rule-policy) will predict a
default action if no [Policy](./policies.mdx) has a prediction for the next
action of the assistant which crosses a configurable threshold.

You can configure the action which is run in case low of Core confidence as well as
the threshold for this as follows:

```yaml
policies:
- name: RulePolicy
  # Confidence threshold for the `fallback_action_name` to apply.
  # The action will apply if no other action was predicted with
  # a confidence >= core_fallback_threshold
  core_fallback_threshold: 0.4
  fallback_action_name: "action_default_fallback"
```

`action_default_fallback` is a default action in Rasa Open Source which sends the
`utter_default` response to the user. Make sure to specify
the `utter_default` in your domain file. It will also revert back to the
state of the conversation before the user message that caused the
fallback, so it will not influence the prediction of future actions.

You can also create your own custom action to use as a fallback (see
[Custom Actions](./actions.mdx#custom-actions) for more info on custom actions).
The following snippet is an implementation of a custom action which does the same as
`action_default_fallback` but dispatches a different template
`my_custom_fallback_template`:

```python
from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List

from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.events import UserUtteranceReverted
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher

class ActionDefaultFallback(Action):
    """Executes the fallback action and goes back to the previous state
    of the dialogue"""

    def name(self) -> Text:
        return ACTION_DEFAULT_FALLBACK_NAME

    async def run(
        self,
        dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
        tracker: Tracker,
        domain: Dict[Text, Any],
    ) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
        dispatcher.utter_message(template="my_custom_fallback_template")

        # Revert user message which led to fallback.
        return [UserUtteranceReverted()]
```
